# MFRE_2022_python_workshops
November 2022 python workshops for MFRE program. Various versions such as student copy and answer key


I recieved the workshops from Krisha Lim (prior MFRE data analytics coordinator) and have made some adjustments and additions to the already very-solid content. 

For Workshop 3, there are several versions:

- `Workshop 3 - Students Codes` is the basic version received from Krisha
- `Workshop 3 - Students Codes Harry Workthrough` is my answer key to the codethrough. It also contains my added exercises at the end with answers
- 'Workshop 3 - Students Codes Exercises Added` is the clean version for student usage.
